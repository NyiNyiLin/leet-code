The person who got even number will always win. <br><br>

if Alice will get 2, he will win. He will always try to get even number in his turn. <br><br>

so if Alice got even number, he will give Bob to odd number. <br>
if Bob got odd number, he only get to choose no 1 and give opponent even number. <br>
so Alice will get even number. and he win <br>
<br>
<br>
if Alice got odd number, he can only choose 1 and give Bob even number. Bob will always choose and give Alice odd number. so Alice will only get odd number. <br>
